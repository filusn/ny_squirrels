In October 2018 the Squirrel Census recorded every squirrel seen in Central Park by 300+ volunteers.
The report of their findings is available on [The Squirrel Census][1] for $75. Now they have made the
data available through [New York City's open data portal][2]. The data includes each squirrel color, 
location, behaviour and more.


This repository contains simple application made with [Streamlit][3]. It contains a short analysis and
visualisations of data from Squirrel Census.
